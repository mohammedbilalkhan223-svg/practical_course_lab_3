"""
Hints:
- Implement the ED_solve function first, it will be useful to decide unit commitment.
- Scenarios contain different sets of devices. You must parse these and set constraints for each.
- The file gives a suggestion on how to:
    - organize your code
    - handle generic names for attributed in pyomo

The device state objects (contained in device.state) have the following  relevant fields:

IdealBatteryState
- size
- soc
- final_soc (the SOC it should have at the end!)
- p_max
- p_min

IdealLoadState
- p_min
- p_max

IdealFuelCellState
- fuel_amount
- p_min
- p_max
- change_max
- p_prev 
    (the power value in the time step before the scheduling start)

    Unit Commitment (UC) solver: decide which devices to commit (use) for the day-ahead schedule.

    Strategy:
    - For each device, evaluate whether committing it leads to a lower total cost (selection cost + operating cost + deviation cost).
    - Use a greedy heuristic: start with no devices committed, then iteratively add the device that provides the largest cost reduction.
    - Use ED_solve to compute the cost for each candidate set of committed devices.
    - Stop when adding more devices no longer reduces the total cost.
